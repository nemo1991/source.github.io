> Watch your thoughts for they become words. Watch your words for they become actions. Watch your actions for they become...habits. Watch your habits, for they become your character. And watch your character, for it becomes your destiny! What we think we become. My father always said that... and I think I am fine. 
所思成所言，所言成所为，所为成习，人格既然，命运不过如此而生！
